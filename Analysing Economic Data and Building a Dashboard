Analyzing US Economic Data and Building a Dashboard
Description
Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, you will extract some essential economic indicators from some data, you will then display these economic indicators in a Dashboard. You can then share the dashboard via an URL.

Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a period. GDP is an indicator of how well the economy is doing. A drop in GDP indicates the economy is producing less; similarly an increase in GDP suggests the economy is performing better. In this lab, you will examine how changes in GDP impact the unemployment rate. You will take screen shots of every step, you will share the notebook and the URL pointing to the dashboard.

Define Function that Makes a Dashboard
We will import the following libraries.

In [1]:
import pandas as pd
from bokeh.plotting import figure, output_file, show
In this section, we define the function make_dashboard. You don't have to know how the function works, you should only care about the inputs. The function will produce a dashboard as well as an html file. You can then use this html file to share your dashboard. If you do not know what an html file is don't worry everything you need to know will be provided in the lab.

In [2]:
def make_dashboard(x, gdp_change, unemployment, title, file_name):
    output_file(file_name)
    p = figure(title=title, x_axis_label='year', y_axis_label='%')
    p.line(x.squeeze(), gdp_change.squeeze(), color="firebrick", line_width=4, legend="% GDP change")
    p.line(x.squeeze(), unemployment.squeeze(), line_width=4, legend="% unemployed")
    show(p)
The dictionary links contain the CSV files with all the data. The value for the key GDP is the file that contains the GDP data. The value for the key unemployment contains the unemployment data.

In [3]:
links={'GDP':'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/projects/coursera_project/clean_gdp.csv',\
       'unemployment':'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/PY0101EN/projects/coursera_project/clean_unemployment.csv'}
Question 1: Create a dataframe that contains the GDP data and display the first five rows of the dataframe.
Use the dictionary links and the function pd.read_csv to create a Pandas dataframes that contains the GDP data.

Hint: links["GDP"] contains the path or name of the file.

In [5]:
# Type your code here
df_gdp = pd.read_csv(links["GDP"])
df_gdp.head()
Out[5]:
date	level-current	level-chained	change-current	change-chained
0	1948	274.8	2020.0	-0.7	-0.6
1	1949	272.8	2008.9	10.0	8.7
2	1950	300.2	2184.0	15.7	8.0
3	1951	347.3	2360.0	5.9	4.1
4	1952	367.7	2456.1	6.0	4.7
Use the method head() to display the first five rows of the GDP data, then take a screen-shot.

In [6]:
# Type your code here
df_gdp.head()
Out[6]:
date	level-current	level-chained	change-current	change-chained
0	1948	274.8	2020.0	-0.7	-0.6
1	1949	272.8	2008.9	10.0	8.7
2	1950	300.2	2184.0	15.7	8.0
3	1951	347.3	2360.0	5.9	4.1
4	1952	367.7	2456.1	6.0	4.7
Question 2: Create a dataframe that contains the unemployment data. Display the first five rows of the dataframe.
Use the dictionary links and the function pd.read_csv to create a Pandas dataframes that contains the unemployment data.

In [7]:
# Type your code here
df_unemp = pd.read_csv(links['unemployment'])
Use the method head() to display the first five rows of the GDP data, then take a screen-shot.

In [8]:
# Type your code here
df_unemp.head()
Out[8]:
date	unemployment
0	1948	3.750000
1	1949	6.050000
2	1950	5.208333
3	1951	3.283333
4	1952	3.025000
Question 3: Display a dataframe where unemployment was greater than 8.5%. Take a screen-shot.
In [13]:
# Type your code here
df_unemp85 = df_unemp[df_unemp['unemployment'] > 8.5]
df_unemp85.head()
Out[13]:
date	unemployment
34	1982	9.708333
35	1983	9.600000
61	2009	9.283333
62	2010	9.608333
63	2011	8.933333
Question 4: Use the function make_dashboard to make a dashboard
In this section, you will call the function make_dashboard , to produce a dashboard. We will use the convention of giving each variable the same name as the function parameter.

Create a new dataframe with the column 'date' called x from the dataframe that contains the GDP data.

In [14]:
# Create your dataframe with column date
x = df_gdp['date']
x.head()
Out[14]:
0    1948
1    1949
2    1950
3    1951
4    1952
Name: date, dtype: int64
Create a new dataframe with the column 'change-current'  called gdp_change from the dataframe that contains the GDP data.

In [16]:
gdp_change = df_gdp['change-current'] # Create your dataframe with column change-current
gdp_change.head()
Out[16]:
0    -0.7
1    10.0
2    15.7
3     5.9
4     6.0
Name: change-current, dtype: float64
Create a new dataframe with the column 'unemployment'  called unemployment from the dataframe that contains the unemployment data.

In [17]:
unemployment = df_unemp['unemployment'] # Create your dataframe with column unemployment
unemployment.head()
Out[17]:
0    3.750000
1    6.050000
2    5.208333
3    3.283333
4    3.025000
Name: unemployment, dtype: float64
Give your dashboard a string title, and assign it to the variable title

In [18]:
title = 'GDP and Unemployment Data'# Give your dashboard a string title
Finally, the function make_dashboard will output an .html in your direictory, just like a csv file. The name of the file is "index.html" and it will be stored in the varable file_name.

In [19]:
file_name = "index.html"
Call the function make_dashboard , to produce a dashboard. Assign the parameter values accordingly take a the , take a screen shot of the dashboard and submit it.

In [23]:
# Fill up the parameters in the following function:
make_dashboard(x=x, gdp_change=gdp_change, unemployment= unemployment, title=title, file_name=file_name)
Question 5: Save the dashboard on IBM cloud and display it
From the tutorial PROVISIONING AN OBJECT STORAGE INSTANCE ON IBM CLOUD copy the JSON object containing the credentials you created. You’ll want to store everything you see in a credentials variable like the one below (obviously, replace the placeholder values with your own). Take special note of your access_key_id and secret_access_key. Do not delete # @hidden_cell  as this will not allow people to see your credentials when you share your notebook.


credentials = {

   "apikey": "your-api-key",

   "cos_hmac_keys": {

    "access_key_id": "your-access-key-here", 

     "secret_access_key": "your-secret-access-key-here"

   },


    "endpoints": "your-endpoints",

   "iam_apikey_description": "your-iam_apikey_description",

   "iam_apikey_name": "your-iam_apikey_name",

   "iam_role_crn": "your-iam_apikey_name",

    "iam_serviceid_crn": "your-iam_serviceid_crn",

  "resource_instance_id": "your-resource_instance_id"

}

In [24]:
# The code was removed by Watson Studio for sharing.
You will need the endpoint make sure the setting are the same as PROVISIONING AN OBJECT STORAGE INSTANCE ON IBM CLOUD assign the name of your bucket to the variable bucket_name 

In [25]:
endpoint = 'https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net'
From the tutorial PROVISIONING AN OBJECT STORAGE INSTANCE ON IBM CLOUD assign the name of your bucket to the variable bucket_name 

In [26]:
bucket_name = 'at-cc-tutorial' # Type your bucket name on IBM Cloud
We can access IBM Cloud Object Storage with Python useing the boto3 library, which we’ll import below:

In [27]:
import boto3
We can interact with IBM Cloud Object Storage through a boto3 resource object.

In [28]:
resource = boto3.resource(
    's3',
    aws_access_key_id = credentials["cos_hmac_keys"]['access_key_id'],
    aws_secret_access_key = credentials["cos_hmac_keys"]["secret_access_key"],
    endpoint_url = endpoint,
)
We are going to use open to create a file object. To get the path of the file, you are going to concatenate the name of the file stored in the variable file_name. The directory stored in the variable directory using the + operator and assign it to the variable html_path. We will use the function getcwd() to find current the working directory.

In [29]:
import os

directory = os.getcwd()
html_path = directory + "/" + file_name
Now you must read the html file, use the function f = open(html_path, mode) to create a file object and assign it to the variable f. The parameter file should be the variable html_path, the mode should be "r" for read.

In [30]:
# Type your code here
f = open(html_path,'r')
To load your dataset into the bucket we will use the method put_object, you must set the parameter name to the name of the bucket, the parameter Key should be the name of the HTML file and the value for the parameter Body should be set to f.read().

In [31]:
# Fill up the parameters in the following function:
resource.Bucket(name=bucket_name).put_object(Key=file_name, Body=f.read())
Out[31]:
s3.Object(bucket_name='at-cc-tutorial', key='index.html')
In the dictionary Params provide the bucket name as the value for the key 'Bucket'. Also for the value of the key 'Key' add the name of the html file, both values should be strings.

In [32]:
# Fill in the value for each key
Params = {'Bucket':bucket_name ,'Key':file_name }
The following lines of code will generate a URL to share your dashboard. The URL only last seven days, but don't worry you will get full marks if the URL is visible in your notebook.

In [33]:
import sys
time = 7*24*60**2
client = boto3.client(
    's3',
    aws_access_key_id = credentials["cos_hmac_keys"]['access_key_id'],
    aws_secret_access_key = credentials["cos_hmac_keys"]["secret_access_key"],
    endpoint_url=endpoint,

)
url = client.generate_presigned_url('get_object',Params=Params,ExpiresIn=time)
print(url)
